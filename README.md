Street Smart Cycling


This is the splash page for the start-up business, Street Smart Cycling.


Current: change overlay on profile images to fit image (not div), fix background color so you can see fields

Things yet to be done:
1. Update Progress Section
2. Brush up the Scout section to be a perfect description of our product
3. Decide whether to keep twitter feed, if yes: make it work (might work when uploaded to server)
4. Verfiy that the code provided for the contact message works and set up email using SSC email as sender (has to be uploaded to server first)
5. Restyle the page so it isn't so similar to the Brushed template
6. Add Timeline? See below




Timeline:
1. Get legit images with dates for goals
2. Make paragraph of text that appears on hover to describe goal
3. Fix dumb centering if I can, right now it is hard-coded with a pixel value
4. Make it responsive
