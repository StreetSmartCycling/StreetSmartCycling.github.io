Street Smart Cycling


This is the splash page for the start-up business, Street Smart Cycling.


Things yet to be done:
1. Decide what to put in Progress Section, including what the filters on the side should be
2. Make pics legit in the About the Team section
3. Brush up the Scout section to be a perfect description of our product
4. Decide which photos to have in slider at the top
5. Make all social media links live
6. Decide whether to keep twitter feed, if yes: make it work (might work when uploaded to server)
7. Verfiy that the code provided for the contact message works and set up email using SSC email as sender (has to be uploaded to server first)
8. Restyle the page so it isn't so similar to the Brushed template



Timeline:
1. Get legit images with dates for goals
2. Make paragraph of text that appears on hover to describe goal
3. Fix dumb centering if I can, right now it is hard-coded with a pixel value
4. Make it responsive
